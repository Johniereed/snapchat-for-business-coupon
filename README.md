## How Much Does a Snapchat for Business Subscription Cost in 2025?

Snapchat for Business doesn't work on traditional subscription pricing. Instead, you pay based on campaign performance and daily budgets.

Current costs show $6.72 per thousand impressions (CPM) and $1.04 per link click as of January 2025.

Here's what different budget levels deliver:

| **Daily Budget** | **Monthly Cost (30 days)** | **Estimated Impressions** | **Estimated Link Clicks** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $5/day | $150 | ~22,300 | ~145 |
| $20/day | $600 | ~89,200 | ~580 |
| $50/day | $1,500 | ~223,000 | ~1,450 |

These numbers represent averages. Your actual performance depends on targeting precision, creative quality, and competition in your industry.

Businesses can start with as little as $5 per day, making Snapchat ads accessible to companies of all sizes.

## How Do I Cancel My Snapchat for Business Subscription?

Since Snapchat ads work on a campaign basis rather than subscriptions, you simply pause or delete campaigns when you want to stop spending money.

Here's the process:

**Where to manage campaigns:**

- Log in to Ads Manager at ads.snapchat.com
- Click "Campaigns" in the left sidebar

**Pausing vs. deleting:**

- Pause: Stops charges immediately, keeps your settings intact
- Delete: Removes the campaign permanently from your account

**When charges stop:**

- Paused campaigns stop spending within minutes
- No new charges once status shows "Paused" or "Ended"

**What happens to the remaining credits:**

- Credits stay in your account until the expiration date
- Use them when you restart campaigns later

**Refunds for unused spend:**

- You're charged only for delivered impressions
- Pause mid-day = pay only for impressions served before pausing

Want to stop all advertising? Simply pause every active campaign in your account. No cancellation process exists because there's no subscription to cancel.

You can leave your account inactive indefinitely and restart campaigns whenever you're ready.
